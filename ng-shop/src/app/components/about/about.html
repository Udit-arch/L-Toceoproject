        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            In an age of streaming and ephemeral licenses, owning physical media is an act of rebellion.
            We are dedicated to the preservation of gaming history, auditory purity, and the tactile experience of
            technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the click of a shutter to the spin of a UMD, every item in our collection has been restored
            to ensure it survives for the next generation of players and listeners.
